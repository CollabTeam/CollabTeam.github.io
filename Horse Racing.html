<h1> Horse Racing </h1>  
<h2>Horse racing is an equestrian performance sport, involving two or more jockeys riding horses over a set distance for competition.</h2>

 <h3> Harness Racing </h3>
 
 <img src="CollabTeam.github.io/images/harness race.jpg">

 <li> Harness racing is a form of horse racing in which the horses race at a specific gait (a trot or a pace). They usually pull a two-wheeled cart called a sulky. </li>
<li> In North America harness races are restricted to Standardbred horses. </li>

<li> Standardbred pacers and trotters compete in separate races, not against each other. That's because they race in two distinct gaits. Both are two-beat gaits. Pacers tend to race faster than their trotting relatives.</li>
 <p> </p>  
<h4> Trotters </h4>
<li> With trotters, the diagonal legs move in unison. The trotting gait is more natural for the horse so most do not need equipment to help them trot, although some wear loops on their front legs to maintain their rhythm, called trotting hobboles. </li>
<h4> Pacers </h4>
<li> Pacers are much more common than trotters, and they tend to go faster.</li>
