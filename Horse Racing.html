<h1> Horse Racing </h1>  
<h2>Horse racing is an equestrian performance sport, involving two or more jockeys riding horses over a set distance for competition.</h2>  
      
 <h3> Thoroughbred Racing</h3>
 
 
 
 <h3> Harness Racing </h3>
 <p> </p>
 <p> Harness racing is a form of horse racing in which the horses race at a specific gait (a trot or a pace). They usually pull a two-wheeled cart called a sulky. </p>

<p> In North America harness races are restricted to Standardbred horses. Standardbreds are so named because in the early years of the Standardbred stud book, only horses who could trot or pace a mile in a standard time of no more than 2 minutes, 30 seconds were admitted to the book. Today, most harness races are won by Standardbreds who post times of 2 minutes or less. Standardbred horses have proportionally shorter legs than Thoroughbreds, and longer bodies. Standardbreds generally have a more placid disposition, due to the admixture of non-Thoroughbred blood in the breed.
 Standardbred pacers and trotters compete in separate races, not against each other. That's because they race in two distinct gaits. Both are two-beat gaits. Pacers tend to race faster than their trotting relatives.</p>
 <p> </p>  
<h4> Trotters </h4>
<p> With trotters, the diagonal legs move in unison. The trotting gait is more natural for the horse so most do not need equipment to help them trot, although some wear loops on their front legs to maintain their rhythm, called trotting hobboles. </p>
<h4> Pacers </h4>
<p> Pacers are much more common than trotters, and they tend to go faster. A pacer moves its legs laterally (right front and right hind together, then left front and left hind.</p>
